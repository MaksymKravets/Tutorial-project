        <h2>So what's the difference between <code class="git">git fetch</code>, <code class="git">git merge</code>
            <code class="git">git pull</code></h2>
        <div class="git-description">
            <p>In the simplest terms, <code class="git">git fetch</code> followed by a <code
                    class="git">git merge</code> equals a <code class="git">git pull</code>. But then why do these
                exist?
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use <code class="git">git pull</code>, Git tries to automatically do your work for you. It is context sensitive, so Git
                will merge any pulled commits into the branch you are currently working in. <code class="git">git pull</code> automatically
                merges the commits without letting you review them first.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you <code class="git">git fetch</code>, Git gathers any commits from the target branch that do not
                exist in your current
                branch and stores them in your local repository. However, it does not merge them with your current
                branch. This is particularly useful if you need to keep your repository up to date, but are working on
                something that might break if you update your files. To integrate the commits into your master branch,
                you use <code class="git">git merge</code>.
